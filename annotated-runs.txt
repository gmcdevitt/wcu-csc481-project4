CL-USER> (parsesentence p1) ; Pretty much a basic sentence, just to make sure things are working

((S (NP (JOHN PROPER-NOUN)) (VP (DID VERB) (NP (HIS DET) (HOMEWORK MNOUN)))))

CL-USER> (parsesentence p2) ; Another somewhat different sanity check (no determiner)

((S (NP (JOHN PROPER-NOUN)) (VP (DROVE VERB) (NP (HOME NOUN)))))

CL-USER> (parsesentence p3) ; This one includes a prepositional phrase, which is cool

((S (NP (JOHN PROPER-NOUN))
  (VP (ATE VERB) (NP (SOME QUANT) (FOOD MNOUN))
   (PP (IN PREP) (NP (THE DET) (GARDEN NOUN))))))

CL-USER> (parsesentence p4) ; I thought this would be an interesting sentence because it uses run as a noun rather than a verb

((S (NP (JOHN PROPER-NOUN))
  (VP (WENT VERB) (PP (FOR PREP) (NP (A DET) (RUN NOUN))))))

CL-USER> (parsesentence p5) ; This one does not use a proper noun 

((S (NP (SOME QUANT) (GLASS MNOUN)) (VP (WAS VERB) (NP (BROKEN NOUN)))))

CL-USER> (parsesentence p6) ; Uses a mass noun properly with a quantifier

((S (NP (THE DET) (RECEPIE NOUN))
  (VP (REQUIRED VERB) (NP (SOME QUANT) (APPLE MNOUN)))))

CL-USER> (parsesentence p7) ; Uses a count noun properly with a number

((S (NP (THE DET) (CABINET NOUN))
  (VP (HAD VERB) (NP (THREE NUM) (CUPS CNOUN)))))

CL-USER> (parsesentence f1) ; This one uses a quantifier and a count noun (some lights), which is incorrect
NIL

CL-USER> (parsesentence f2)  ; This one uses a mass noun but tries to put a number in front of it (three hair). Trying to mean three strands of hair.
